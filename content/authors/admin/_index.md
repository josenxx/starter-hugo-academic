I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at Purdue University in Construction Management Technology in the Polytechnic Institute. I am now pursuing a Ph.D. with Dr. Jiansong Zhang. My anticipated graduation date is June 2022. I am writing to express my interest in the tenure-track faculty position of Assistant Professor. My research interest is focused on increasing the degree of automation in construction activities by developing computational methods and tools. My dissertation research addresses the conversion of natural language building codes from natural language to a computer-processable, formal, and structured format for a BIM-based Automated Code Compliance (ACC) system.
